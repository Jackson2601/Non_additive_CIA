## Abstract

**1.**	Human induced stressors are impacting the oceans and reducing the biodiversity of its ecosystems. The many stressors affecting marine environments do not act in isolation. However, their cumulative impact is difficult to predict, despite representing a much more likely real-world scenario. Current cumulative impact assessment methods for marine systems assume that the impacts of stressors are independent and can simply be summed to estimate cumulative impact. We propose that non-additive stressor interactions may lead to unknown cumulative impacts, which are likely not accounted for in commonly used cumulative impact assessment methods. 

**2.**	We used a data driven approach to extend a widely-used additive model for marine spatial cumulative impact assessment by incorporating non-additive (synergistic and antagonistic) stressor interactions. The experimental data on the impact of multiple stressors, was combined with spatial data on stressor intensity to test whether stressor interactions impact seagrasses in a case study region in South Australia. The results from a traditional (additive) cumulative impact assessment model were compared with results from the model incorporating non-additive interactions. Uncertainty analyses around our estimates are reported, which illustrate how the inclusion of non-additive interactions affects uncertainty in the cumulative impact estimates.

**3.**	Spatial cumulative impact assessment estimates from the interaction model had a wider range of scores than those predicted by the additive model. Five of the 15 interacting stressors tested significantly deviated from the additive model. Areas of our study region that showed the largest discrepancies between the additive and interactive outputs were associated with higher uncertainty.

**4.**	*Synthesis and application:* Current cumulative impact assessment methods often rely on models that assume additive stressor impacts. However, our study demonstrates that the inclusion of non-additive stressor interactions changes the pattern and intensity of modelled spatial cumulative impact. Our results indicate that additive models have the potential to both underestimate and overestimate cumulative impact. This highlights the importance of including realistic assumptions about how stressors may be interacting in marine ecosystems when attempting to model these impacts. Appropriate inclusion of interacting stressor data may have implications for the identification of key stressors and the subsequent spatial planning and management of marine ecosystems and the biodiversity they contain.
